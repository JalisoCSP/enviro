    <h2>
      Frequently Asked Questions
    </h2>
    <p>
      A residential property needs rewiring approximately every 25 years, so it's not something most people deal with very often.  Here at Enviro Rewire our expert advice will guide you through the whole process. Here are some of the most common questions people have:
    </p>

    <h3>
      What do I need to do before the rewire begins?
    </h3>
    <p>
      A rewire will always cause some disruption to your life, however quickly it's completed.  If you can, consider planning it for a time that won't cause unnecessary stress.  Make a plan of all of the things you'll need from your home over the next 24 hours and keep them all together.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Will I need to redecorate?
    </h3>
    <p>
      We endeavour to be as tidy as possible, but a rewire will inevitably cause damage to walls because we have to have access to the wiring.  Make sure a rewire is completed before any decorating takes place.  We can arrange plasterers and decorators to follow our rewire if you would like us to manage to whole process for you.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Will my furniture get damaged?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Please move and cover any furniture to the middle of the room prior to our visit if you can.  If you have any problems doing this, please let us know beforehand so we can make sure we are ready to start promptly on the morning of your rewire.
    </p>

    <h3>
    How much will it cost?
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is difficult to say as costs vary from property to property.  One of our rewire experts will come out and provide a free, no obligation quote.  Our prices are competitive and we won't be beaten on quality and efficiency.
